        <h1 id="My-journey-of-learning-Economics–why-i-love-this-subject-2021-6-21"><a href="#My-journey-of-learning-Economics–why-i-love-this-subject-2021-6-21" class="headerlink" title="My journey of learning Economics–why i love this subject (2021/6/21)"></a>My journey of learning Economics–why i love this subject (2021/6/21)</h1><h2 id="What-i-did-in-my-childhood"><a href="#What-i-did-in-my-childhood" class="headerlink" title="What i did in my childhood"></a>What i did in my childhood</h2><p>When I was 9, I began to show an interest in accounting and modeling . I guess I loved those mainly because I wanted to save more money. (Actually I have been developed this habit now.) By learning accounting, I could realize the thing I didn’t need to buy and thus using my money in a more efficient way. By modeling, I could use mathematic knowledge I learned in my classroom to solve practical problems like identifying which scheme would use the lowest money to buy the most goods.</p>
<h2 id="Backgrounds-for-Chinese-junior-high-students"><a href="#Backgrounds-for-Chinese-junior-high-students" class="headerlink" title="Backgrounds for Chinese junior high students"></a>Backgrounds for Chinese junior high students</h2><p>Since finance is not a compulsory subject in Chinese junior high schools, I had no choice but to give up my dreams of learning it temporarily. The majority of Chinese students, including me, did time-consuming extra-curricular work in order to pass tough examinations to access senior high schools. Despite this, I continued acquiring knowledge about modeling as I thought that it may be useful in Finance. I sometimes did self-study by downloading online books about Matlab during my senior high school years. </p>
<h2 id="Special-opportunity-for-me-being-an-A-level-student"><a href="#Special-opportunity-for-me-being-an-A-level-student" class="headerlink" title="Special opportunity for me (being an A-level student)"></a>Special opportunity for me (being an A-level student)</h2><p>In Grade 10, I was delighted to be provided with the opportunity to learn Economics at our A-level centre. I have been learning Business knowledge enthusiastically. In order to get excellent final exam results, I study this subject as soon as I finish my dinner every evening.</p>
<h2 id="My-experience-of-learning-Economics-at-school"><a href="#My-experience-of-learning-Economics-at-school" class="headerlink" title="My experience of learning Economics at school"></a>My experience of learning Economics at school</h2><p>It is worth mentioning that we have two capable economics teachers. Whenever I have problems, they give me a helping hand to solve them and boost my comprehension further. They are like friends accompanying with me when I am in trouble, rather than simply teachers focused on teaching the syllabus. For example, I got an 80 percent mark in a mock exam, which made me feel sad. My economics teacher did not criticize me at that time. Instead, he smiled at me and said What happened?” Later, he helped me correct my mistakes and I have had much better results in exams since that time.</p>
<h2 id="What-i-did-for-my-further-study"><a href="#What-i-did-for-my-further-study" class="headerlink" title="What i did for my further study"></a>What i did for my further study</h2><p>Then my economics teacher advised me to take part in a business contest called The Future Business Leader of America. My classmates and I achieved China top 18th in this teamwork event. During the event, I was surprised by how little I knew about economic terms and concepts, so I developed the habit of reading economic essays regularly to broaden my horizons. Thanks to the presentation we did there, I realized that my poor communication skills could have an adverse effect on my academic progress. As a result, I have practiced my speaking by giving more presentations in class.</p>
