    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h1 id="My-journey-of-learning-Economics–why-i-love-this-subject-2021-6-21"><a href="#My-journey-of-learning-Economics–why-i-love-this-subject-2021-6-21" class="headerlink" title="My journey of learning Economics–why i love this subject (2021/6/21)"></a>My journey of learning Economics–why i love this subject (2021/6/21)</h1><h2 id="What-i-did-in-my-childhood"><a href="#What-i-did-in-my-childhood" class="headerlink" title="What i did in my childhood"></a>What i did in my childhood</h2><p>When I was 9, I began to show an interest in accounting and modeling . I guess I loved those mainly because I wanted to save more money. (Actually I have been developed this habit now.) By learning accounting, I could realize the thing I didn’t need to buy and thus using my money in a more efficient way. By modeling, I could use mathematic knowledge I learned in my classroom to solve practical problems like identifying which scheme would use the lowest money to buy the most goods.</p><h2 id="Backgrounds-for-Chinese-junior-high-students"><a href="#Backgrounds-for-Chinese-junior-high-students" class="headerlink" title="Backgrounds for Chinese junior high students"></a>Backgrounds for Chinese junior high students</h2><p>Since finance is not a compulsory subject in Chinese junior high schools, I had no choice but to give up my dreams of learning it temporarily. The majority of Chinese students, including me, did time-consuming extra-curricular work in order to pass tough examinations to access senior high schools. Despite this, I continued acquiring knowledge about modeling as I thought that it may be useful in Finance. I sometimes did self-study by downloading online books about Matlab during my senior high school years. </p><h2 id="Special-opportunity-for-me-being-an-A-level-student"><a href="#Special-opportunity-for-me-being-an-A-level-student" class="headerlink" title="Special opportunity for me (being an A-level student)"></a>Special opportunity for me (being an A-level student)</h2><p>In Grade 10, I was delighted to be provided with the opportunity to learn Economics at our A-level centre. I have been learning Business knowledge enthusiastically. In order to get excellent final exam results, I study this subject as soon as I finish my dinner every evening.</p><h2 id="My-experience-of-learning-Economics-at-school"><a href="#My-experience-of-learning-Economics-at-school" class="headerlink" title="My experience of learning Economics at school"></a>My experience of learning Economics at school</h2><p>It is worth mentioning that we have two capable economics teachers. Whenever I have problems, they give me a helping hand to solve them and boost my comprehension further. They are like friends accompanying with me when I am in trouble, rather than simply teachers focused on teaching the syllabus. For example, I got an 80 percent mark in a mock exam, which made me feel sad. My economics teacher did not criticize me at that time. Instead, he smiled at me and said What happened?” Later, he helped me correct my mistakes and I have had much better results in exams since that time.</p><h2 id="What-i-did-for-my-further-study"><a href="#What-i-did-for-my-further-study" class="headerlink" title="What i did for my further study"></a>What i did for my further study</h2><p>Then my economics teacher advised me to take part in a business contest called The Future Business Leader of America. My classmates and I achieved China top 18th in this teamwork event. During the event, I was surprised by how little I knew about economic terms and concepts, so I developed the habit of reading economic essays regularly to broaden my horizons. Thanks to the presentation we did there, I realized that my poor communication skills could have an adverse effect on my academic progress. As a result, I have practiced my speaking by giving more presentations in class.</p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h1 id="Wonderful-experience-of-laser-cutting-–-we-even-did-it-at-school-（-2021-6-22）"><a href="#Wonderful-experience-of-laser-cutting-–-we-even-did-it-at-school-（-2021-6-22）" class="headerlink" title="Wonderful experience of laser cutting – we even did it at school!（ 2021/6/22）"></a>Wonderful experience of laser cutting – we even did it at school!（ 2021/6/22）</h1><h2 id="Backgrounds-why-we-could-do-it-at-school"><a href="#Backgrounds-why-we-could-do-it-at-school" class="headerlink" title="Backgrounds- why we could do it at school"></a>Backgrounds- why we could do it at school</h2><p>Our school has a center called Steam, which aimed to provide different kinds of extra curriculums for students. This center is well-equiped,for example, it has complex laser cutting equipment, that means we have the opportunity to access laser world–laser cutting!</p><h2 id="Activities-what-we-did-here"><a href="#Activities-what-we-did-here" class="headerlink" title="Activities- what we did here"></a>Activities- what we did here</h2><p>We used an application online to model different objects. Then we sent our designs to teachers’ computers and they manipulated laser cutting machines by using a computer to cut wood boards.It is worth mentioning that we could bring our designs back home as souvenirs!</p><h2 id="What-i-did-there"><a href="#What-i-did-there" class="headerlink" title="What i did there"></a>What i did there</h2><p> Actually i  downloaded a picture about The University of Toronto on the Internet in order to make a fridge magnet in the morning. It was so  successful that our Physic teacher showed my work in front of my classmates. In the afternoon, since i had already experienced the way to use the modeling application,i designed a box with cover.It took me 2 hours, and i also asked for help during this process.</p><p>My fridge magnet is here below.</p><p><img src="https://i.loli.net/2021/06/22/YXiwg71ICWfBprK.jpg" alt="IMG20210622184440.jpg"></p><p>You could see there are two tiny magnets to help this stick on the walls of fridges.<br><img src="https://i.loli.net/2021/06/22/oU8DjPs9XTdH4nN.jpg" alt="QQ图片20210622190055.jpg"></p><p>This is the box i made.</p><p><img src="https://i.loli.net/2021/06/22/5oxKdktYDe4FXQC.jpg" alt="QQ图片20210622185055.jpg"></p><p>It’s clearly there is a cover.</p><p><img src="https://i.loli.net/2021/06/22/oU8DjPs9XTdH4nN.jpg" alt="QQ图片20210622190055.jpg"></p><h2 id="The-thing-that-made-me-feel-quite-terrible"><a href="#The-thing-that-made-me-feel-quite-terrible" class="headerlink" title="The thing that made me feel quite terrible."></a>The thing that made me feel quite terrible.</h2><p>To be honest, i put pictures about different top universities in the Canada and UK originally on the box. However, the laser cutting couldn’t draw complicated pictures. As a result, you could only see a little bit pictures on my box!</p><p><img src="https://i.loli.net/2021/06/22/Pu6XIUwHZQsBEtg.jpg" alt="QQ图片20210622191952.jpg"></p><p>I also made some other fridge magnets.They didn’t have  clear university pictures as well. Here is an example.</p><p><img src="https://i.loli.net/2021/06/22/RHL71ntXGicPayW.jpg" alt="IMG20210622191656.jpg"></p><h2 id="My-feelings–-what-i-learned-from-today’s-experience"><a href="#My-feelings–-what-i-learned-from-today’s-experience" class="headerlink" title="My feelings– what i learned from today’s experience"></a>My feelings– what i learned from today’s experience</h2><h3 id="For-my-interests"><a href="#For-my-interests" class="headerlink" title="For my interests"></a>For my interests</h3><p>Generally speaking,on the technical level, i had learned the exact way how laser cutting operating. I was surprised that how precise the laser cutting is–the box i made was as good as the handicraft boxes the shops sold. It may boost my comprehension further about engineering–Tell you the truth,i loved handicrafts,and todays’ experience may let me decide to learn engineering in the univerisity.(I decided to learn either Chemistry or Business before.)</p><h3 id="For-my-fault"><a href="#For-my-fault" class="headerlink" title="For my fault"></a>For my fault</h3><p>During today’s event, i didn’t consider about how precise the laser cutting could reach. As a result, i didn’t make a fancy box with different universities’ pictures.(And i wasted some materials as well.) It taught me a lesson that i should think twice before doing something. This may also explain why i made some stupid choices before. I couldn’t change the  history, but the thing is that, i could learn how to behave better from my daily life.</p>]]></content>
