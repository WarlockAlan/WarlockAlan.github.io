### Review

Chapter 16 is Monopolistic Competition. This chapter introduces monopolistic competition, a kind of market structure.

* Monopolistic competition is a market structure in which many firms sell products that are similar but not identical.

> Characteristics

* Many sellers: There are many firms competing for the same group of customers.
* Product differentiation: Each firm produces a product that is at least slightly different from those of other firms. Thus, rather being a price taker, each firm faces a downward- sloping demand curve.
* Free entry and exit: Firms can enter or exit the market without restriction. Thus, the number of firms in the market adjusts until economic profits are driven to zero.

* Firms cannot earn economic profits in the long run.
* P > MC
* Profit maximization: sell goods at the quantity where MR = MC

* Efficient scale is the quantity where MC = ATC.
* Excess capacity is the difference between efficient scale and quantity produced.
* Markup is the difference between price and marginal cost.
