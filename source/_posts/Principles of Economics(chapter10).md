### Summary
Chapter 10 is Externalities. This chapter introduces the situation when the producers and consumers are not the only interested parties.

* Externalities include external cost and external benefit.
* Externalities make the equilibrium not the optimum.
* The use of tax or subsidy can make the equilibrium equal to the optimum if the new supply curve(private cost) coincides with the social-cost curve.

* Corrective tax and pollution permits are used for decreasing negative externality.
* Pollution permits mean the firms can buy the rights to pollute more from other firms.
* Pollution permits could be better because different kinds of firms have the different cost to avoid polluting. 
* Regulation can be another way to limit the negative externality. If the negative externality is much greater than the private benefits, the regulation would be better.

> Coase theorem is the proposition that if private parties can bargain without cost over the allocation of resources, they can solve the problem of externalities on their own.

* Private parties may not solve the problem of negative externality if the process of bargain has the cost.

### Definitions

1. Externality-- the uncompensated impact of one person's actions on the well-being of a bystander

2. Internalizing the externality-- altering incentives so that people take into account the external effects of their actions

3. Corrective taxes-- a tax designed to induce private decision makers to take into account the social costs that arise from a negative externality

4. Coase theorem-- the proposition that if private parties can bargain without cost over the allocation of resources, they can solve the problem of externalities on their own

5. Transaction costs-- the costs that parties incur during the process of agreeing to and following through on a bargain
