* Natural monopoly is a type of monopoly that arises because a single firm can supply a  good or service to an entire market at a lower cost than could two or more firms

* A monopolist's marginal revenue is less than the price of its good because of the downward-sloping demand curve.

> Profit maximization

* Find the Q at which MR = MC.
* On the demand curve, find P at which consumers will buy Q.
* If P > ATC, the monopoly earns a profit.

**For a competitive firm: P=MR=MC**

**For a monopoly firm: P>MR=MC**

> The deadweight loss

* A benevolent social planner maximizes total surplus in the market by choosing the level of output where the marginal cost curve and demand curve intersect.

* Because a monopoly charges a price above the marginal cost, not all consumers who value the good at more than its cost buy it. It causes the deadweight loss.

> Price discrimination

* Price discrimination is the business practice of selling the same good at different prices to different customers.

* Because different consumers have different willingnesses to buy the same good, the price discrimination increases the total surplus.

> Differences between Competition and Monopoly
