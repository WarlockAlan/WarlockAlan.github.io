### Backgrounds

We had three case studies on July 21st. In each 30-minute case study session, group members needed to read the whole case and chose three representatives who answer three questions respectively. The cases were in English and representatives were allowed to answer the question in Chinese.

### What I did

I was a representative to answer the second question during one case study. That case introduced how Starbuck be famous all around the world. The question I needed to answer is to explain how you could see Kevin (the Starbuck CEO) is brave enough to burden the risk and how he realized Starbuck would be in trouble in 2007.

Although representatives could also speak Chinese to answer questions, I still answered the questions in English in order to strengthen my poor English-speaking skill. Except using information about introducing the situation of Starbuck from the main body, I also noticed the information (a diagram) in appendix. The diagram showed that the revenue of Starbuck increased while its net profit decreased from 2006 to 2007, which helped me to explain how the Starbuck could be in trouble.

### My feelings

Thanks to my previous experience of giving a presentation, I was not so frightened of it. However, I was poor in speaking English so I thought I didn't perform well at that time. Anyway, my friends were so kind that they encouraged me and said I was good enough. I felt lucky and impressed to meet these friends.

### The ending

We finally finished the Emerging Leader Summit. Here is a photo to record this journey.
