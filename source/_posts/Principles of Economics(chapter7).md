###Summary

Chapter 7 is Consumers, Producers, and the Efficiency of Markets. This chapter explains consumer surplus, producer surplus and the total surplus in the market.

> Consumer surplus
 
*  the amount a buyer is willing to pay for a good minus the amount the buyer actually pays for it

> Producer surplus

* the amount a seller is paid for a good minus the seller's cost of providing it

**Total surplus= consumer surplus + producer surplus= (value to byers- amount paid by buyers)+ (amount received by sellers- cost to sellers)**

* amount paid by buyers= amount received by sellers- cost to sellers

* Total surplus= value to buyers- cost to sellers

> Efficiency of Market



* Free markets allocate the supply of goods to the buyers who value them most, as measured by their willingness to pay.
* Free markets allocate the demand for goods to the sellers who can produce then at the lowest cost.
* Free markets produce the quantity of goods that maximizes the sum of consumer and producer surplus.
