### Summary

Chapter 17 is Oligopoly. This chapter introduces oligopoly, a kind of market structure.

* Oligopoly is a market structure in which only a few sellers offer similar or identical products

> Prisoner Dilemma

**Prisoners' dilemma is a particular "game" between two captured prisoners that illustrates why cooperation is difficult to maintain even when it is mutually beneficial.**

* Each player will choose the best strategy for them regardless of the strategies chosen by others.

* In this picture, each player will choose to defect although cooperation is mutually beneficial.

> Nash equilibrium

* Each company will choose to produce more goods in order to get more market shares rather than producing fewer to keep the market price high.

* As the supply increases, the market price decreases.

* Each company stops producing more goods as their total revenue decreases, the quantity they produce is called Nash equilibrium.

* The quantity supplied in oligopoly is greater than that in monopoly, but smaller than that in the competitive market.
