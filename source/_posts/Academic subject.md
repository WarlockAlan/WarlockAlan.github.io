**Introduction**

One of the academic subjects that has boosted my further interest is Economics. This short essay will demonstrate my journey of learning it.

**Background**

I could only start studying Economics in Grade 10, because it was not available on the curriculum before then. (Economics is a subject which can only be studied by international students because it is not a compulsory subject for Chinese national education system.)

**Experience of learning Economics**

Despite my relatively poor English, I still understood the main points from my English Economics teacher quickly perhaps I worked hard in it. Learning about supply and demand in commerce caught my interest quickly in Economics and I found it fascinating and wanted to learn more in this field, for instance, how a market works. I became aware of the need to improve my English language skills when I did not understand some specific vocabulary such as vice versa, ceteris paribus and capita. From then on, I read English books to improve my lexical resources. For example, the book Principles of Economics which illustrates some fundamentals in Economics. From this book, I was surprised to find there is a strong relationship between Mathematics and Economics, for instance, you could use calculus(integration)to calculate total welfare in one market. This opened up a whole new world to me because I did well in Mathematics which helped me study this field in more depth. I finished all exercises in each chapter and made reading notes to summarize the main points.

**Experience of taking part in FBLA**

Because of my outstanding performance in the final exam of the semester, my teacher suggested that I take part in a business contest which was called The Future Business Leader of America (FBLA). The preparation was intense but I learnt a great deal of new information which the school syllabus had not provided. Then I cooperated with two partners to do a presentation focused on a business plan about attracting investment from investors and received excellent scores. I strengthened not only my economic knowledge but also speaking skills during the preparation of the presentation.

**Conclusion**

In conclusion, I have been capable and motivated to learn more about Economics and I hope to focus more on this interesting subject in the future and perhaps study it at university level.
