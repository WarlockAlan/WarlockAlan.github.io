### Introduction

An experience which expressed my creativity was to design a website that contained many interesting functions, for example, a specific dictionary to search for definitions of important words in IGCSE or A-level coursebooks. This short essay will focus on my story of writing such a website. 

### Reasons to construct an online dictionary

Originally, I came up with this idea because I found it is quite difficult to give economic definitions in the IGCSE examinations. Unlike other subjects such as Physics or Chemistry, Economics textbooks do not list definitions in the appendix, which means I could not answer questions with standardized definitions. I even searched for answers in past papers but they still had different descriptions for one economic term. Thus, I planned to make an online dictionary which recorded different types of descriptions for economic terms in as many ways as possible.

### Solving problems

However, it is hard to construct and update a website. In addition to programming it, which is a complex step, you also need to be aware of fixing possible bugs as you add more definitions to the dictionary. (Any error could make your code not work any more.) As a student, I did not have enough time to programme and maintain an online dictionary, so I came up with an idea; I could copy and modify codes which helped me construct a website on the Internet and rent a computer server like Google servers to help me maintain the website. This idea was innovative because few senior high students rent a server to set up a website. So, I asked one of my friends, Justin, who did well in Computer Sciences, to confirm the possibility of executing my plan. To my surprise, he said not only that my plan was feasible but he owned a mini server, which meant I did not have to pay for Google. In addition, Justin was interested in my plan and wanted to join me. He was welcomed by me. With his help, I built up a website which not only contains definitions from textbooks, but also a repository for online notes. 

### Meaning

Thanks to my creative ideas and thinking, I have ensured I will study more efficiently in the future and always look to solve problems through innovative thinking.
