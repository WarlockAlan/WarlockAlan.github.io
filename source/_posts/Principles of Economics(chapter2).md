### Summary

Chapter 2 is Thinking Like an Economist. This chapter shows two kinds of economic models, some history stories about Economics and many examples to explain the way of how economists think.

**Economic models**

> The circular-flow diagram

* You can see how dollars flow among households and firms in the economy.
* In the markets for goods and services, firms are sellers and households are buyers.
* In the markets for factors of production, firms are buyers and households are sellers.

> The production possibilities frontier/curve

* This is a curve to explain opportunity cost, efficiency, inefficiency and unachievable.
* As the diagram shows, the points A,B and C stand for efficiency. The point X is inefficiency and the point Y is unachievable.
* The point A moves towards the point C means the opportunity cost of some cottons are some amounts of wines.

**The way of economists think**

> The phenomenon of ticket resale.

Lawmakers sometimes try to prohibit reselling tickets, or "scalping" as it is sometimes called, in order to keep the ticket price low. However, many economists side with the scalpers rather than the lawmakers. They think the ticket price without scalping cannot show the real value of the ticket. The rule influences market force(the invisible hand).
* Laws that limit the resale of tickets for entertainment and sports events make potential audience members for those events worse off on average.
