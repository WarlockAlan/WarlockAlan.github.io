* Without tax, the consumer surplus is A+B+C, the producer surplus is D+E+F.
* With tax, the tax revenue is B+D, the consumer surplus is A, the producer surplus is F.
* C+E is deadweight loss(welfare loss).
* Deadweight loss occurs when the total surplus of the consumption is smaller than the tax required. At that time, people will not consume goods, that means consumers and producers will not get surplus they should get if the tax is not imposed. Besides, tax is not levied on this consumption because this consumption does not exist.

* Each diagram has a same size of tax.
* The greater the elasticities of supply and demand, the larger the deadweight loss of a tax.

* As the tax rate increases, the tax revenue increases first. Then it decreases.
* The deadweight loss surges as the tax rate increases(because the area of triangle is the deadweight loss).
* The curve shows that the tax revenue first increases then decreases is called Laffer curve.
