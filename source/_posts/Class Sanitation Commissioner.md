### Backgrounds and my responsibility

In the beginning of Grade 10, my class advisor asked me to be the Class Sanitation Commissioner. It is a job to manage the students to clean our classroom and deliver meals from canteens to our class. Originally, my class advisor let me to do this simply because I was the only one who lived in the school dormitory since this job was time-consuming. (The Class Sanitation Commissioner needed to supervise students to do their work after school.)

### What I did at first

At the beginning, I needed to make a table to make sure each student in our class had their position (like sweeping the floor in Monday or cleaning the blackboard in Wednesday). But I made a mistake at that time--I let my classmates choose the positions they want. After I asked them to choose positions they want in our QQ group online, I realized I shouldn't do that. Obviously, some classmates complained that they wanted to do another work, and the process of choosing students was time-consuming. Finally, our monitor advised me to redistribute positions by myself and I did it.

> What I have learned from it

Sometimes I should think twice before making a decision. Tell you the truth, when I redistributed the positions, some of my classmates argued with me. That was my fault because I let them choose work they want before.
### The cooperation between two Class Sanitation Commissioners

As time passes, our class advisor realized it was difficult for one Class Sanitation Commissioners to do all works so she asked another student to do this work as well.
Generally speaking, we didn't split the responsibilities the Class Sanitation Commissioner should take into two totally different parts. Some classmates used to say it was not wise to do so because we may ask the other Class Sanitation Commissioner to bear responsibilities. However, as something wrong in our classroom (about sanitation), one of us would bear the duty actively when the other one was absent.

> By the way, thanks to this experience, I even made friends with another Class Sanitation Commissioner, Jason. We discuss tough questions in the spare time.

### What we and I did during this year

Except stuffs I have mentioned before, the obligations also include passing the check from school supervisors every week and taking the disinfectant from another building every day.
It is worth mentioning that our class pass each check excellently.

> Each year, our school asks us to choose one person who bears the most obligations and provides the greatest services for students in each class. Obviously, the Class Sanitation Commissioners take more duties than others. And I take the disinfectant every day, that means I bear a little bit more duty than another Class Sanitation Commissioner, Jason.

### My feelings 

Through being a Class Sanitation Commissioner is really exhausting, I was still grateful to get this opportunity. I strengthened my ability to lead others to bear their own duty. During this process, I developed the spirit of helping my classmates and bearing responsibilities actively. Besides, I got to know how to communicate with classmates efficiently and kindly. Sometimes students may be angry about duties they have. They may think it is unfair and complain it with Class Sanitation Commissioner. In order to avoid getting into trouble (like arguing), it's important for us to handle such things properly. I used to go mad easily, now I'm much better in terms of controlling my feelings. Last but not least, I have learned how to organize students to do suitable work. For example, students in our class thought it was easy to clean the blackboard so they all chose to do this work. And I chose someone who wasn't capable enough to do other work to clean the blackboard.
