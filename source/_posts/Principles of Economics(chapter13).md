### Summary

Chapter 13 is the Cost of Production. This chapter introduces revenue, cost and profit.

> Revenue

* Total revenue is the amount a firm receives for the sale of its output.
* Revenue = quantity * price

> Cost

* Explicit cost is input cost that requires an outlay of money by the firm.
* Implicit cost is input cost that does not require an outlay of money by the firm.
* Fixed cost is cost that does not vary with the quantity of output produced.
* Variable costs is cost that varies with the quantity of output produced.

> Profit 

* Profit = Total revenue - Total cost
* Economic profit is total revenue minus total cost, including both explicit and implicit costs.
* Accounting profit is total revenue minus total explicit cost.
* Total opportunity cost is implicit cost pluses explicit cost.

> Production function

* The relationship between the quantity of inputs used to make a good and the quantity of output of that good.

> Diminishing marginal product 

* The property whereby the marginal product of an input declines as the quantity of the input increases.

* Due to it, the production function gets flatter as the number of input increases.

* Due to it, the total-cost curve gets steeper as the quantity of output increases.

* Profit maximization

* Average total cost = marginal cost

### Definitions

1.Total revenue-- the amount a firm receives for the sale of its output

2.Total cost-- the market value of the inputs a firm uses in production

> TC = FC + VC

3.Profit-- total revenue minus total cost

4.Explicit costs-- input costs that require an outlay of money by the firm

5.Implicit costs-- input costs that do not require an outlay of money by the firm

6.Economic profit-- total revenue minus total cost, including both explicit and implicit costs

7.Accounting profit-- total revenue minus total explicit cost

8.Production function-- the relationship between the quantity of inputs used to make a good and the quantity of output of that good

9.Marginal product-- the increase in output that arises from an additional unit of input

10.Diminishing marginal product-- the property whereby the marginal product of an input declines as the quantity of the input increases

11.Fixed cost-- costs that do not vary with the quantity of output produced

> FC

12.Variable costs-- costs that vary with the quantity of output produced

> VC

13.Average total cost-- total cost divided by the quantity of output

> ATC = TC / Q

14.Average fixed cost-- fixed cost divided by the quantity of output

> AFC = FC / Q

15.Average variable cost-- variable cost divided by the quantity of output

> AVC = VC / Q

16.Marginal cost-- the increase in total cost that arises from an extra unit of production

> MC =  <a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=\frac{\Delta&space;TC&space;}{\Delta&space;Q&space;}" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\frac{\Delta&space;TC&space;}{\Delta&space;Q&space;}" title="\frac{\Delta TC }{\Delta Q }" /></a>

17.Efficient scale-- the quantity of output that minimizes average total cost

18.Economies of scale-- the property whereby long-run average total costs falls as the quantity of output increases

19.Diseconomies of scale-- the property whereby long-run average total cost rises as the quantity of output increases

20.Constant returns to scale-- the property whereby long-run average total cost stays the same as the quantity of output changes

### Review

I did all questions correctly! Excellent!
