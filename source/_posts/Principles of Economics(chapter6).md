### Summary
Chapter 6 is Supply, Demand, and Government Policies. This chapter explains maximum price, minimum price and how sellers/consumers burden the tax.

>Maximum price

* Also called price ceiling-- a legal maximum on the price at which a good can be sold

* If the maximum price is lower than the equilibrium price, we call it a price ceiling that is binding(because this price ceiling will affect the equilibrium price).

* The quantity demanded will increase and quantity supplied will decrease so there is shortage(excess demand).

>Minimum price

* Also called price floor-- a legal minimum on the price at which a good can be sold

* If the minimum price is higher than the equilibrium price, we call it a price floor that is binding(because this price floor will affect the equilibrium price).

* The quantity demanded will decrease and quantity supplied will increases so there is surplus(excess supply).

* For elastic supply and inelastic demand, buyers burden more tax than sellers.

* For inelastic supply and elastic demand, sellers burden more tax than sellers.

**Conclusion: A tax burden falls more heavily on the side of the market that is less elastic.**
