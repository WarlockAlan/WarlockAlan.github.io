> Introduction
My greatest skill is my ability to use study skills to enhance my understanding of school subjects. These involve the study skills of doing efficient research online, managing time wisely and cooperate with others to solve problems if necessary. This short essay will illustrate how I have been developing and strengthening these study skills.

> Background
My home is far away from the school and therefore I live in the school dormitory during weekdays so my parents cannot accompany me as well as give me help. The majority of students in our class tend to have extra-curricular classes to improve their learning in order to get excellent exam scores. For me, I consider self-study to be more advantageous so I do it instead of having those extra curricular-classes.

> My study experiences
In the textbooks I use, it is necessary to answer questions in order to check if I have mastered knowledge precisely. However, these questions are limited so I then use the internet to find appropriate exercises. Doing past papers is a good choice, but the majority of them only cover one unit. So, I collaborate with another student to classify questions that cover chapters we have already learned and organize them in an online file. In addition, I pay for an annual subscription of a website called Save My Exams which provides appropriate questions. This website is useful because it addresses individual topics in detail rather than more generally therefore it is more in-depth and improves my learning.

> The skill i need to develop
I am keen to avoid procrastination which is the enemy to these study skills especially in terms of time management. I did not master Physics knowledge due to this lack of organizing my time well in revising physics, I did badly in the monthly exam which was disappointing due to the lack of review which occurred owing to my poor ability to execute my plan of reviewing science subjects.  

> Conclusion
Overall, because of my experience living in the school dormitory, I have been strengthening my self-study skills which will be beneficial for me when I attend university.
