### My unique school life

Truth to be told, I lived in school dormitory, that makes my school life quite different compared with other students, since I need to live at school 5 days per week and have breakfast, lunch and dinner at canteen as well. Other students, however, just need to go to school at seven twenty in the morning and go back their home in the 5 p.m.

### Daily routines

*My daily routine has a little bit difference due to living in the school dorm (SWOT Analysis )*

 Students in my class are asked to go to the classroom at 0730. Then we have 30 minutes reading time. From 0800, we have lessons at different periods. We have 10 periods at school every day and we're allowed to go back home at 0500.


> Advantages

I get up at six fifty every day in the school dormitory, then I go to the school canteen to have breakfast at seven o'clock. I get up late compared with my classmates since they have to spend time commuting. Even though, they still go to the classroom nearly 0730. In contrast, I arrive at my classroom at 0720 and even have 10 minutes spare time to do the self-study.

> Disadvantages

I have no choice but to have terrible meals at school every day. It sometimes makes me feel sick and decreases my efficiency of study.

> Opportunities

Only a few students live in the school dorm, that means I may feel isolated from time to time. However, that also means that no one could disturb me to study.

Besides, the majority of students who live in the dorm are top students, I could learn the way how they study. But it also means the peer pressure is hectic for me.

> Threats

The self-study room has a poor signal, that means it's hard for me to use digital devices sometimes. As an international student, I couldn't live without them in order to look through websites of different universities.

### My Feelings

One of my friends used to say that it may be wise for me to rent a flat nearby my school. Actually, my parents rented a flat when I was in the junior high. (My mother has retired so she has enough time.)

But I didn't think it was be a good choice. Generally speaking, I didn't want to disturb my mother's live since she had retired. In addition, I personally reckon that I must get benefits from my school life. 

First, I do self-study in the evening and ask for my teachers' help if I need it. (My teachers sometimes work overload until evening) During my school life, I have already developed the ability to concentrate myself to do self-study by reading textbooks or searching information online. I suppose I could fit the self-study life in the university rapidly since I have already lived in this life for a long time.

Second, I can avoid feeling isolated or even depressed though I live alone. Tell you the truth, when I concentrate on studying, I even forget about time. (And I seldom keep in touch with my parents during weekday.)  Since culture gap exists, some international students may feel depressed and homesick when they go abroad to study, which makes them perform badly in their study. Obviously, I was not one of them.


Third, thanks to my school life, I have developed the habit to make to-do list to manage my time properly. Many students, including me, feeling relaxed and wasting their time at home. 
As I don't have any way to do the entertainment, I must study hard at school (and get great exam scores as well).

Last but not the least, I can do the majority of things in my everyday life now. Actually, many students, especially the Chinese students, having a poor ability to live alone.

In other word, I enjoy my life living in the school dormitory.
