### Summary

Chapter 18 is The Markets for the Factors of Production. This chapter introduces the market for labour, land and capital.

> The versatility of supply and demand

* The price of labours is the wage rate.
* The market price and quantity of labours are determined by the demand and supply of labours.

* Production function is the relationship between the quantity of inputs used to make a good and the quantity of output of that good.

> The value of the marginal product of labour

* Value of the marginal product is the marginal product of an input times the price of the output 
* It decreases as the quantity of labour increases (because of the diminishing marginal product)
* Diminishing marginal product is the property whereby the marginal product of an input declines as the quantity of the input increases
* The market wage is equal to the value of marginal product
