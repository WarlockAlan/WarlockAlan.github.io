# A brief summary of my Github experience (2021/6/24)

## Why i do it

I have used Github for several months(although i just updated articles recently). Actually. my original purpose of using Github is just to record contests and extra-curriculums i did and show my feelings about them. However, thanks to Github, I was interested in recording my daily life gradually. In addition, i write this article to thank for one of my friends, Justin, who helped me a lot to give me technical support about how to use Github.

## My feelings of using Github (Programming part)

Tell you the truth, it's quite difficult for me to set my own Github repository since i don't have the gift for programming. It is worth mentioning that Github is not suitable for the Greenhand, since it needs complex codes to operate. I used to search information online to set my Githb blog（it took me nearly two weeks, but i was not totally successfully-- I didn't know how to send my articles to Github! Anyway, at least i developed my skills of self-study and searching information during this process.

## My feelings of using Github (Writing articles part)

With my friend Justin's help( I will mention it later), i could push my articles to my Github easily. I was proud of my Github whenever i see the layout of it is fantastic (at least i think so). In addition, i have a sense of achievement when i see my articles on it.

What's more, i have been developing the habit of recording my daily life gradually. I was surprised when i saw my previous experience (I nearly forgot half of them). I used to think that keeping diaries is just a waste of time. Thanks to Github, i found it was quite meaningful.

Finally, i must mention that my English writing skill is improved. Some of my classmates were confused why i didn't use my mother tongue to write articles on Github. I wanted to strengthen my ability to write English articles and obviously i wouldn't lose this chance.

## My contributor Justin and more 

I am grateful to Justin for his helping hand. Generally speaking, I could say that i cannot use Github so comfortably without Justin's help. 

First, he made a linkage to my repository, that means i can push my articles to Github much easier. 

Besides, he helped me to change the theme in Github. The theme in Github can be described as a format you used in your Github. Each format has its own pictures and layout. Justin let me look through some websites to choose a theme l love, (Without his guide, i even couldn't find the websites to download themes) then he changed the theme by himself. （I just loved a few themes, but he was so patient that he helped me to choose a reliable theme. In addition, it was time-consuming and complex to change a theme, i even didn't how to change it.）He also taught me many useful skills such as judging which theme was good by looking through the functions it has. I used to judge it only by which picture it had was beautiful.

Last but not least, i also acquired quite a great amount of useful knowledge about Computer Science from Justin. For example, the way how the Github operates. I used to simply learn how to use Github, but i did never think about what is Github before Justin teaching me.

## Conclusion

I was keen on updating articles on Github, not only i loved recording my daily life, but also I met my friend Justin through Github.
