### Summary

Chapter 11 is Public Goods and Common Resources. This chapter divides the goods into four categories by using the definition of excludability (he property of a good whereby a person can be prevented from using it) and rivalry in consumption(the property of a good whereby one person's use diminishes other people's use).

> Private goods

* Rival in consumption
* Excludable
* e.g ice-cream cones, clothing, congested toll roads

> Club goods

* Not rival in consumption
* Excludable
* e.g satellite TV, fire protection, uncongested toll roads

> Common resources

* Non-excludable
* Rival in consumption
* e.g fish in the ocean, the environment, congested non-toll roads
* The common resources tend to be used excessively.

> Public goods

* Non-excludable
* Not rival in consumption
* e.g tornado siren, national defense, uncongested non-toll roads
* People who receive the benefit of a good but avoid paying for it is called free riders.
