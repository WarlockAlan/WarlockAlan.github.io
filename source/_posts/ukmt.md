# My experience of UKMT ,Grade 10, in Autumn (2020/10/20)
## What is this contest  

UKMT is the initial of United Kingdom Mathematics,aimed at encouraging students to practice and analyse Maths.  

## My final exam results 

On the October of 2020,I took part in this contest and finally achieved gold certificate.(I got 103 out of 125,while the requirement for it was getting 86 points.)

## My reasons to attend it and feelings

I am keen on learning Maths and do well in analysing and tackling practical problems in terms of Maths.When I heard of UKMT,I reckoned that it was a good opportunity for me to strengthen my fundamental mathematic skills in order to learn better in the future for further Maths.In addition to show my abilities in maths field,I also wanted to learn.    
about the style of Maths questions in countries except China.Tell you the truth, I have never done such kinds of questions since I was getting used to finish questions from China.Thanks to UKMT and my efforts, I got to know structures of exams in other countries.    

## My preparation of UKMT  

In order to achieved my goal of getting gold certificate,I previewed past paper and chose paper from 2015 to 2019 to do,which was a process that quite brought benefits to me.I learned not only some specific ways to solve problems, but also the quality of being diligent.I decided to give up several times when I prepared it.However, I insisted in completing it since it was my first time to contact foreign maths questions(I really would like to harvest something in this field like characteristics or certificate,so I spent one hour doing related questions during that period)  

## My expectation

I did some mistakes beacuse I was daydreaming at that time,I wish I could do it in 2021 and get higher scores(maybe 120,nearly full marks)
