Text mining uses natural language processing (NLP), allowing machines to understand the human language and process it automatically.</p></blockquote><h5 id="Normalisation"><a href="#Normalisation" class="headerlink" title="Normalisation"></a>Normalisation</h5><blockquote><p>Text normalization is the process of transforming text into a single canonical form that it might not have had before.</p></blockquote><p>Stemming and lemmatisation are two approaches for text normalisation.</p><p>1.Lemmatization is a text normalization technique used in Natural Language Processing (NLP), that switches any kind of a word to its base root mode. Lemmatization is responsible for grouping different inflected forms of words into the root form, having the same meaning.</p><p><strong>Lemma: the basic form of a word, for example the singular form of a noun or the infinitive form of a verb, as it is shown at the beginning of a dictionary entry</strong></p><p>2.In linguistic morphology and information retrieval, stemming is the process of reducing inflected (or sometimes derived) words to their word stem, base or root form—generally a written word form.</p><blockquote><p>notes in Chinese</p></blockquote><p>最常见的词汇规范化的实践有：</p><ol><li><p>词干提取（Stemming）：词干提取是一个初级的、基于规则的脱去后缀（如“ing”，“ly”，“es”，“s”等等）的过程</p></li><li><p>词元化（Lemmatization）：另一方面，词元化，是一个组织好的、一步一步的获取词根的过程。</p></li><li><p>词汇规范化: 另外一种文本型的噪音与一个词语的多种表达形式有关。例如，“play”，“player”，“played”，“plays”和“playing”都是单词“play”的变种。尽管它们有不同的意思，但是根据上下文来看，它们是意思是相似的。这个步骤是将一个单词的所有不同形式转换为它的规范形式（也被称为词条（lemma））</p></li></ol><h4 id="Opinion-mining"><a href="#Opinion-mining" class="headerlink" title="Opinion mining"></a>Opinion mining</h4><blockquote><p>Opinion mining, or sentiment analysis, is a text analysis technique that uses computational linguistics and natural language processing to automatically identify and extract sentiment or opinion from within text (positive, negative, neutral, etc.)</p></blockquote><p>In my words, opinion mining is just one part in text mining; text mining involves classical text mining and opinion mining；The former one analyses text which are expressed factually whereas the latter one analyses text which are expressed subjectively.</p><blockquote><p>Sentiment analysis, also referred to as opinion mining, is an approach to natural language processing (NLP) that identifies the emotional tone behind a body of text. This is a popular way for organizations to determine and categorize opinions about a product, service, or idea. It involves the use of data mining, machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) to mine text for sentiment and subjective information.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Emotional tone refers to positive, negative or neutral attitudes.</strong></p><h4 id="Subjectivity-polarity-score"><a href="#Subjectivity-polarity-score" class="headerlink" title="Subjectivity polarity score"></a>Subjectivity polarity score</h4><p>The polarity score is a float within the range [-1.0, 1.0] . The subjectivity is a float within the range [0.0, 1.0] where 0.0 is very objective and 1.0 is very subjective. </p><p>In short, text polarity is a measure of how negative or how positive a piece of text is.<br>Most of the time, NLP models can predict simply positive or negative words and phrases quite well. For example, the words “amazing”, “superb”, and “wonderful” can easily be labelled as highly positive. The words “bad”, “sad”, and “mad” can easily be labelled as negative. However, we can’t just look at polarity from the frame of individual words, it’s important to take a larger context for evaluating total polarity. For example, the word “bad” may be negative but what about the phrase “not bad”? Is that neutral? Or is that the opposite of bad? At this point we’re getting into linguistics and semantics rather than natural language processing.</p><p>The two biggest open source libraries for NLP in Python are spaCy and NLTK, and both of these libraries measure polarity on a normalized scale of -1 to 1. The Text API measures, combines, and normalizes values on both the polarity of the overall text, individual sentences, and individual phrases.</p><blockquote><p>Example <a href="https://www.ebaina.com/articles/140000005269">https://www.ebaina.com/articles/140000005269</a><br>notes in Chinese</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>极性(polarity)指的是一陈述是肯定还是否定的性质，如果某个词只能出现在肯定或者否定的陈述中，那么这个词就是极性项(polarity item)。在英语中at all是一个否定极性项，它只能出现在否定句中。</p></blockquote><h4 id="Opinion-holders-and-opinion-targets"><a href="#Opinion-holders-and-opinion-targets" class="headerlink" title="Opinion holders and opinion targets"></a>Opinion holders and opinion targets</h4><p>One of the key subtasks in sentiment analysis is opinion role extraction. It can be divided into the extraction of opinion holders (OH), i.e. entities ex-pressing an opinion, and the extraction of opinion targets (OT), i.e. entities or propositions at which sentiment is directed.</p>]]></content>

It also perform well in multi class prediction</p></li><li><p>When assumption of independence holds, a Naive Bayes classifier performs better compare to other models like logistic regression and you need less training data.</p></li><li><p>It perform well in case of categorical input variables compared to numerical variable(s).

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p><p>One of the academic subjects that has boosted my further interest is Economics. This short essay will demonstrate my journey of learning it.</p><p><strong>Background</strong></p><p>I could only start studying Economics in Grade 10, because it was not available on the curriculum before then. (Economics is a subject which can only be studied by international students because it is not a compulsory subject for Chinese national education system.)</p><p><strong>Experience of learning Economics</strong></p><p>Despite my relatively poor English, I still understood the main points from my English Economics teacher quickly perhaps I worked hard in it. Learning about supply and demand in commerce caught my interest quickly in Economics and I found it fascinating and wanted to learn more in this field, for instance, how a market works. I became aware of the need to improve my English language skills when I did not understand some specific vocabulary such as vice versa, ceteris paribus and capita. From then on, I read English books to improve my lexical resources. For example, the book Principles of Economics which illustrates some fundamentals in Economics. From this book, I was surprised to find there is a strong relationship between Mathematics and Economics, for instance, you could use calculus(integration)to calculate total welfare in one market. This opened up a whole new world to me because I did well in Mathematics which helped me study this field in more depth. I finished all exercises in each chapter and made reading notes to summarize the main points.</p><p><strong>Experience of taking part in FBLA</strong></p><p>Because of my outstanding performance in the final exam of the semester, my teacher suggested that I take part in a business contest which was called The Future Business Leader of America (FBLA). The preparation was intense but I learnt a great deal of new information which the school syllabus had not provided. Then I cooperated with two partners to do a presentation focused on a business plan about attracting investment from investors and received excellent scores. I strengthened not only my economic knowledge but also speaking skills during the preparation of the presentation.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>In conclusion, I have been capable and motivated to learn more about Economics and I hope to focus more on this interesting subject in the future and perhaps study it at university level.</p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>Introduction</p></blockquote><p>My greatest skill is my ability to use study skills to enhance my understanding of school subjects. These involve the study skills of doing efficient research online, managing time wisely and cooperate with others to solve problems if necessary. This short essay will illustrate how I have been developing and strengthening these study skills.</p><blockquote><p>Background</p></blockquote><p>My home is far away from the school and therefore I live in the school dormitory during weekdays so my parents cannot accompany me as well as give me help. The majority of students in our class tend to have extra-curricular classes to improve their learning in order to get excellent exam scores. For me, I consider self-study to be more advantageous so I do it instead of having those extra curricular-classes.</p><blockquote><p>My study experiences</p></blockquote><p>In the textbooks I use, it is necessary to answer questions in order to check if I have mastered knowledge precisely. However, these questions are limited so I then use the internet to find appropriate exercises. Doing past papers is a good choice, but the majority of them only cover one unit. So, I collaborate with another student to classify questions that cover chapters we have already learned and organize them in an online file. In addition, I pay for an annual subscription of a website called Save My Exams which provides appropriate questions. This website is useful because it addresses individual topics in detail rather than more generally therefore it is more in-depth and improves my learning.</p><blockquote><p>The skill i need to develop</p></blockquote><p>I am keen to avoid procrastination which is the enemy to these study skills especially in terms of time management. I did not master Physics knowledge due to this lack of organizing my time well in revising physics, I did badly in the monthly exam which was disappointing due to the lack of review which occurred owing to my poor ability to execute my plan of reviewing science subjects.  </p><blockquote><p>Conclusion</p></blockquote><p>Overall, because of my experience living in the school dormitory, I have been strengthening my self-study skills which will be beneficial for me when I attend university.</p>]]></content>

The majority of students in my class, including me, always advocate that IGCSE Mathematic examination is easier compared with the Chinese alternative because students need to in Chinese alternative. During the lesson, I used to feel extremely bored and spend the whole course session daydreaming, which caused me to omit some important formulae. After nearly one-month, we were given a mock examination. My exam result was average rather than excellent which was disappointing. Thus, I liaised with the high achieving students and found that they paid full attention to listening to the teacher during class. </p><blockquote><p>From then on, I had previewed and reviewed each mathematic chapter gradually to make sure I could master mathematic formulae clearly. But I still had a problem which was I was too careless. Here is one of my stories.</p></blockquote><h3 id="My-experience-of-Euclid-Contest"><a href="#My-experience-of-Euclid-Contest" class="headerlink" title="My experience of Euclid Contest"></a>My experience of Euclid Contest</h3><p>Three months after the mock examination, I took part in a mathematic contest called Euclid at school which was a little bit difficult because no multiple choices in it. Due to my inattention, I even forgot that our teacher had said there were no multiple choices. In addition, I did not read the question correctly because I read so fast which meant I misunderstood some questions and answered them incorrectly. The results showed that I got 68 out of 100 and the international top 25% required 69 marks.</p><h3 id="Summary"><a href="#Summary" class="headerlink" title="Summary"></a>Summary</h3><p>This contest experience taught me a number of lessons. First, it encouraged me to study harder in the mathematics field as questions in the contest were difficult. Second, I have developed a good learning habit which is reviewing and previewing. Finally, this experience made me try the best and I realized I should be more attentive and improve my concentration and motivation if I want to fulfil my potential.</p>]]></content>
